            I'm currently a full stack developer on my way to start my masters
            degree in computer science.
            <br />
            <br />
            I spent the better part of my bachelors in the medical
            instrumentation lab. I was constatly involved in projects where I
            programmed FPGAs and embedded systems on breadboards to acquire and
            process all kinds of biological signals. These projects helped me
            truly understand the logic behind programming, which I had the
            pleasure of experiencing through a variety of languages ranging from
            Assembler to MATLAB.
            <br />
            <br />
            In 2019 I began my professional journey in Chicago, where I
            completed an internship at Northwestern University. At the time I
            was in the midst of completing my undergraduate thesis project, in
            which I programmed the embedded software for a biomedical device
            prototype. It was then that I realized that software development was
            not only fun, but it's something I'm passionate about. I would work
            full time at the lab and part time as a server, yet still come home
            late at night eager to continue working on my thesis to implement
            new ideas that had surfaced during the day.
            <br />
            <br />
            Six months prior to graduating, I started working as a web
            developer. I was thrilled to be able to explore another facet of the
            world of software engineering. Working with a small, closely knit
            team allowed me to see my work evolve from ideas all the way into
            deployment. This was where I realized I wanted to focus my love for
            programming towards web development.
            <br />
            <br />I have always found great joy in tackling problems by
            searching for pragmatic, straightforward solutions. I believe in the
            power of simplicity.
