        <div className='about-body'>
            I'm currently a full stack developer on my way to start my masters
            degree in computer science.
            <br />
            <br />
            I spent the better part of my bachelors in the medical
            instrumentation lab. I was constatly involved in projects where I
            programmed FPGAs and embedded systems on breadboards to acquire and
            process all kinds of biological signals from my colleagues and I.
            These projects helped me truly understand the logic behind
            programming, which I had the pleasure of experiencing through a
            variety of languages ranging from Assembler to MATLAB.
            <br />
            <br />
            In 2019 I began my professional journey in Chicago, where I
            completed an internship at Northwestern University. At the time I
            was in the midst of completing my thesis project, in which I
            programmed the embedded software for a biomedical device prototype.
            It was then that I realized that development was not only a very
            alluring career path, but my true passion. I would work full time at
            the lab and part time as a server, yet still come home late at night
            eager to continue working on my thesis to implement new ideas that
            had surfaced during the day.
            <br />
            <br />
            Six months prior to graduating, I started working as a web
            developer. I was thrilled to be able to explore another facet of the
            world of software engineering. Aside from the technical skills,
            working with a small, closely knit team has allowed me to get
            involved in tasks with great responsibility. I have had the
            opportunity to see my work being deployed out there, where it has
            the potential of impacting lives.
            <br />
            <br />
            In my free time, when I'm not practicing yoga or reading, I like to
            learn on my own. My latest interest is ReactJS, and I have completed
            a Complete React Developer course online to learn all about the most
            important tools it has to offer. Currently I'm working on personal
            projects to hone my skills.
            <br />
            <br />I have always found great joy in tackling problems by
            searching for pragmatic, straightforward solutions. I believe in the
            power of simplicity.
